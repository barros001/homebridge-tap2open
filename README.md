## Overview

The Homebridge Tap2Open plugin seamlessly integrates your Tap2Open platform with Apple HomeKit, allowing you to manage your gates effortlessly. Once configured, all gates associated with your Tap2Open account will appear in HomeKit as Garage Door Openers. Users can conveniently open their gates using the Home app or Siri voice commands. Please note that this plugin only supports opening gates, not closing.
